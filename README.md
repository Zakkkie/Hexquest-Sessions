# HexQuest Economy

**HexQuest Economy** is a strategic hexagonal exploration game where economic management is as crucial as territorial expansion. Compete against AI Sentinels, manage your resources (Coins & Moves), and master the upgrade cycle to dominate the procedural world.

## 🎮 Game Overview

You are a Commander tasked with expanding into a new sector. The world is infinite, procedural, and guarded by AI competitors.

### Core Mechanics

*   **Movement & Resources**:
    *   Moving costs **Moves**.
    *   If you run out of Moves, you must burn **Credits (Coins)** to propel yourself (Exchange Rate: 2 Coins = 1 Move).
    *   Strategic resource management is vital to avoid being stranded.

*   **Growth & Upgrades**:
    *   Stand on a hex and activate **GROWTH** to increase its level.
    *   **Leveling Up** grants Coins and Moves.
    *   **Cycle Lock**: You cannot upgrade the same hex repeatedly. You must rotate your upgrades across different sectors to maintain the "Upgrade Queue".

*   **Rank System**:
    *   Your **Player Level** determines your clearance.
    *   You cannot traverse or upgrade hexes with a level higher than your current Rank.
    *   Level up lower-tier hexes to increase your Rank.

*   **Sentinels (AI)**:
    *   Hostile bots inhabit the world. They expand, gather resources, and can block your path.
    *   Collision with a Sentinel halts your movement.

### Win Conditions
Configurable at the start of a session:
1.  **Wealth**: Accumulate a specific amount of Coins.
2.  **Domination**: Reach a specific high Level (Rank).
